    <!-- I weighed whether or not I should use bootstrap CSS to get some out-of-the-box responsiveness and styling, since maybe
         you wanted to see me define some responsive CSS manually myself. In the end I opted for using bootstrap, because for real
         projects, unless there is a requirement not to use pre-existing libraries, I think you should not reinvent the wheel, and 
         bootstrap is going to do a better job than I could do manually in a short time frame. -->
         
    <!-- @TODO if I have time however, I may define some manual CSS that could apply if you choose to comment out the bootstrap CSS
         here -->
